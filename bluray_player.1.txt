optical drive.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
bluray_player(1) uses libmpv as the engine for playback (see
<https://mpv.io/>). Configuration for bluray_player is stored in
~/.config/bluray_player/mpv.conf and will be read on each time during startup.

Passing options to 'bluray_player' will override the configuration file.

See mpv(1) for all configuration options.

BUGS
----
*bluray_player* does not wait for an optical device to be ready. Wait for it to
finish "polling" before running the program.
