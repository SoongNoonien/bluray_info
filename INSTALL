I've tried my best to port this to a lot of x86 and x86_64 systems on
various operating systems, so it should just build and run out of the
box. Check out https://dvds.beandog.org/ for latest build instructions
on your OS.

bluray_info doesn't package the autotools components with the source code,
so you will need to rebuild them if manually building it. You will also
need pkg-config installed.

You can see bluray_device.h to see which OSes it's been ported and tested
for. If it's listed in there, it will use the default optical drive.

If you want to use bluray_player, libmpv must be installed on the system,
and then add '--with-libmpv' to './configure'

DragonFly BSD
-------------
# pkg install autoconf automake pkgconf libaacs libbluray
# ./configure
# make
# make install

Gentoo Linux
------------
# emerge bluray_info

Linux
-----
Assuming all your build essentials are already installed:
# autoreconf -fi
# ./configure
# make
# make install

NetBSD
------
You will have needed to install pkgsrc first.
# pkgin install automake autoconf pkgconf libaacs libbluray
# ./configure
# make
# make install

OpenBSD
-------
# pkg_add autoconf-2.69p2 automake-1.16.1 libaacs libbluray
# AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16 autoreconf -fi
# ./configure
# make
# make install
