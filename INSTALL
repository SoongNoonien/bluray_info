I've tried my best to port this to a lot of various operating systems, so it should just build and run out of the box. Check out https://github.com/beandog/bluray_info/wiki for build instructions on your OS.

You can see bluray_device.h to see which operating systems it's been ported to and tested on. If it's listed in there, it will use the default optical drive.

If you want to use bluray_player, libmpv must be installed on the system.

Assuming cmake is already installed:

$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo make install

If for some reason you are having problems with cmake, the original autotools will work. Install autoconf, automake, and m4 first.

$ autoreconf -fi
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
